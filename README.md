offline-editor-js
=================

A prototype JavaScript toolkit for using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript offline. It manages both editing and tiles in an offline mode. It's still a work-in-progress so if you have suggestions open an issue or if you want to make a pull request we welcome your proposed modifications. 

*IMPORTANT:* If you want a full, robust offline solution then you should be using our ArcGIS Runtime SDKs for .NET, WPF, Java, iOS, Android and Qt.

This repo contains the following libraries:

- `/edit`: handles vector features and stores adds, updates and deletes while offline. Resync's edits with server once connection is reestablished
   * `offlineFeaturesManager` - Extends and overrides a feature layer.
   * `editsStore` - Provides static helper methods for working with the offline data store.
- `/tiles`: stores portions of tiled maps client-side and uses the cached tiles when device is offline
   * `offlineTilesEnabler` Extends and overrides a tiled map service.
- `/utils`: contains various helper libraries.
- `/samples`: sample apps to show how to use different aspects of the offline library capabilities.

#Workflows Supported (v1)
The following workflow is currently supported for both both features and tiles:

1) Load web application while online.
 
2) Once all tiles and features are loaded then programmatically take application offline. 

3) Make edits while offline.

4) Return online when you want to resync edits.

Using an [application manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) allows you to reload and restart the application while offline. The application manifest let's you store .html, .js, .css and image files locally.

__Attachment Support__: Attachments are supported with some limitations. See documentation [here](./doc/attachments.md)


#Classes documentation

##offlineFeaturesManager
Extends and overrides a feature layer. This library allows you to extend esri.layers.FeatureLayer objects with offline capability and manage the resync process.


###Constructor
Constructor | Description
--- | ---
`OfflineFeaturesManager()` | Creates an instance of the offlineFeaturesManager class. This library allows you to extend FeatureLayer objects with offline editing capabilities and manage the online/offline resynchronization process.

###ENUMs
The manager can be in one of these three states (see `getOnlineStatus()` method):

Property | Description
--- | ---
offlineFeaturesManager.ONLINE | all edits will directly go to the server
offlineFeaturesManager.OFFLINE | edits will be enqueued
offlineFeaturesManager.RECONNECTING | sending stored edits to the server

###Methods
Methods | Returns | Description
--- | --- | ---
`extend(layer)`|nothing|Overrides a feature layer, by replacing the `applyEdits()` method of the layer. You can use the FeatureLayer as always, but it's behaviour will be different according to the online status of the manager.
`goOffline()` | nothing | Forces library into an offline state. Any edits applied to extended FeatureLayers during this condition will be stored locally.
`goOnline(callback)` | `callback( boolean, errors )` | Forces library to return to an online state. If there are pending edits, an attempt will be made to sync them with the remote feature server. Callback function will be called when resync process is done.
`getOnlineStatus()` | `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE` or `RECONNECTING`| Determines the current state of the manager. Please, note that this library doesn't detect actual browser offline/online condition. You need to use the `offline.min.js` library included in `vendor\offline` directory to detect connection status and connect events to goOffline() and goOnline() methods. See `military-offline.html` sample.
`getReadableEdit()` | String | A string value representing human readable information on pending edits.


###Events
Application code can subscribe to offlineFeaturesManager events to be notified of different conditions. 

```js
	offlineFeaturesManager.on(
		offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT, 
		function(edits) 
		{
			...
		});
```

Event |  Description
--- | ---
offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT | When any edit is actually sent to the server.
offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_ENQUEUED | When an edit is enqueued and not sent to the server.
offlineFeaturesManager.events.ALL_EDITS_SENT |  After going online and there are no pending edits remaining in the queue.

###FeatureLayer Overrides

Methods | Returns | Description
--- | --- | ---
`applyEdits(`  `adds, updates, deletes,`  `callback, errback)` | `deferred`| applyEdits() method is replaced by this library. It's behaviour depends upon online state of the manager. You need to pass the same arguments as to the original applyEdits() method and it returns a deferred object, that will be resolved in the same way as the original, as well as the callbacks will be called under the same conditions. This method looks the same as the original to calling code, the only difference is internal.

##editsStore

Provides a number of public static methods that are used by `offlineFeaturesManager` lib. They provide a low-level storage mechanism using indexedDb browser functions. These methods don't require a `new` statement or a constructor. After the module has been included in your application you can access these methods directly for example: `editsStore.getEditsStoreSizeBytes();`.

###Public Methods
Methods | Returns | Description
--- | --- | ---
`isSupported()` | boolean | Determines if local storage is available. If it is not available then the storage cache will not work. It's a best practice to verify this before attempting to write to the local cache.
`hasPendingEdits()` | boolean | Determines if there are any queued edits in the local cache.
`pendingEditsCount()` | int | The total number of edits that are queued in the local cache.
`getEditsStoreSizeBytes()` | Number | Returns the total size of all pending edits in bytes.
`getLocalStorageSizeBytes()` | Number | Returns the total size in bytes of all items for local storage cached using the current domain name. 

 
##offlineTilesEnabler
Extends and overrides a tiled map service. Provides the ability to customize the extent used to cut the tiles. See the detailed description of basemap.prepareForOffline() in the "How To Use" section below to learn different options.

###Constructor
Constructor | Description
--- | ---
`OfflineTilesEnabler()` | Creates an instance of the offlineTilesEnabler class. This library allows you to extend an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer with offline capability as well as manage the online/offline resynchronization process.


###Methods
Methods | Returns | Description
--- | --- | ---
`extend(layer, callback)`|`callback(boolean, string)` |Overrides an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer. Callback is called after indexedDb store is initialized and informs the application whether it is indexedDb is supported or not.

###Properties
Property  | Description
--- | ---
`layer.offline.proxyPath`| For CORS enabled servers this can be set to `null`. The default is to use the internal resource-proxy path: `libs/offline-editor-js/resource-proxy/proxy.php.` Don't forget to check your proxy configuration to allow connections for all possible services that you might be using. More information on using proxies with ArcGIS can be found here: [https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html).

###ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer Overrides

Methods | Returns | Description
--- | --- | ---
`getTileUrl(level, row, col)` | Url | Use the tile url's level, row and column. Retrieves tiles as requested by the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. If a tile is in cache it is returned. If it is not in cache then one is retrieved over the internet. 
`goOffline()` | nothing | This method puts the layer in offline mode. When in offline mode, the layer will not fetch any tile from the remote server. It will look up the tiles in the indexed db database and display them in the layer. If the tile can't be found in the local database it will show up blank (even if there is actual connectivity). The pair of methods `goOffline()` and `goOnline() `allows the developer to manually control the behaviour of the layer. Used in conjunction with the offline dectection library, you can put the layer in the appropriate mode when the offline condition changes.
`goOnline()` | nothing | This method puts the layer in online mode. When in online mode, the layer will behave as regular layers, fetching all tiles from the remote server. If there is no internet connectivity the tiles may appear thanks to the browsers cache, but no attempt will be made to look up tiles in the local database.
`getLevelEstimation(extent,` `level, tileSize)` | {level, tileCount, sizeBytes} | Returns an object that contains the number of tiles that would need to be downloaded for the specified extent and zoom level, and the estimated byte size of such tiles. This method is useful to give the user an indication of the required time and space before launching the actual download operation. The byte size estimation is very rough.
`getExtentBuffer(buffer,extent)`| Extent | Returns a new extent buffered by a given measurement that's based on map units. For example, if you are using mercator map projection then the buffer property would be in meters and the new extent would be returned in mercactor.
`getTileUrlsByExtent(extent, level)` | Array | Returns an array of tile urls within a given map extent and zoom level.
`deleteAllTiles(callback)` | `callback(boolean, errors)` | Clears the local cache of tiles.
`getOfflineUsage(callback)` | `callback(size, error)` | Gets the size in bytes of the local tile cache.
`getTilePolygons(callback)` | `callback(polygon, error)` | Gets polygons representing all cached tiles. This is helpful to give users a visual feedback of the current content of the tile cache.
`saveToFile(filename, callback)` | `callback( boolean, error)` | Saves tile cache into a portable csv format.
`loadFromFile(filename, callback)` | `callback( boolean, error)` | Reads a csv file into local tile cache.
`estimateTileSize(callback)` | `callback(number)` | Retrieves one tile from a layer and then returns its size.
`prepareForOffline(` `minLevel, maxLevel, extent,  ` `reportProgress)`  | `callback(number)` | Retrieves tiles and stores them in the local cache. See the "How To Use" section below to learn more about customizing the use of this method.

#How to use

##`tiles` library


The `tiles` library allows a developer to extend a tiled layer with offline support.

**Step 1** Configure paths for dojo loader to find the tiles and vendor modules (you need to set paths relative to the location of your html document), before loading ArcGIS JavaScript API

```html
	<script>
		// configure paths BEFORE loading arcgis or dojo libs
		var locationPath = location.pathname.replace(/\/[^/]+$/, "");
		var dojoConfig = {
			paths: { 
				tiles: locationPath  + "/../../lib/tiles",
				vendor: locationPath + "/../../vendor"
			}
		}
	</script>
	<script src="//js.arcgis.com/3.7compact"></script>

```

**Step 2** Include the `tiles/offlineTilesEnabler` library in your app.

```js
	require([
		"esri/map", 
		"tiles/offlineTilesEnabler"], 
		function(Map,OfflineTilesEnabler)
	{
		...
	});
```
**Step 3** Once your map is created (either using new Map() or using esriUtils.createMap(webmapid,...), you extend the basemap layer with the offline functionality

```js
	var basemapLayer = map.getLayer( map.layerIds[0] );
	var offlineTilesEnabler = new OfflineTilesEnabler();
	offlineTilesEnabler.extend(basemapLayer, function(success)
	{
		if(success)	{
			// Now we can use offline functionality on this layer 
		} else {
			alert('indexed db is not supported in this browser');
		}
	});
```
**Step 4** Use the new offline methods on the layer to prepare for offline mode while still online:

####basemap.getLevelEstimation(extent, level, tileSize)
Returns an object that contains the number of tiles that would need to be downloaded for the specified extent and zoom level, and the estimated byte size of such tiles. This method is useful to give the user an indication of the required time and space before launching the actual download operation:

```js
	{
		level: /* level number */
		tileCount: /* count of tiles */
		sizeBytes: /* total size of tiles */	
	}
	
**NOTE**: The byte size estimation is very rough.
```
####basemap.prepareForOffline(minLevel,maxLevel,extent,reportProgress)

* Integer	minLevel
* Integer	maxLevel
* Extent	extent
* callback	reportProgress(Object progress)

This method starts the process of downloading and storing in local storage all tiles within the specified extent. 

For each downloaded tile it will call the reportProgress() callback. It will pass an object with the following fields

```js
	{
		countNow: /* current count of downloaded tiles */
		countMax: /* number of total tiles that need to be downloaded */
		error: /* if some error has happened, it contains an error object with cell and msg fields, otherwise it is undefined */
		finishedDownloading: /* boolean that informs if this is the last cell */
		cancelRequested: /* boolean that informs if the operation has been cancelled at user's request */
	} 
```
**NOTE:** The reportProgress() callback function should return `true` if the download operation can be cancelled or `false` if it doesn't need to be.

You can also add a buffer around the view's extent:

```js
var minLevel = 0;
var maxLevel = 16;
var extent = someFeature.geometry.getExtent();
var buffer = 1500; /* approx meters (webmercator units) */
var newExtent = basmapLayer.getExtentBuffer(buffer,extent);
basemapLayer.prepareForOffline(minLevel, maxLevel, newExtent,
   lang.hitch(self,self.reportProgress));
```

####basemap.deleteAllTiles(callback)
Deletes all tiles stored in the indexed db database.
The callback is called to indicate success (true) or failure (false,err)

####basemap.getOfflineUsage(callback)
It calculates the number of tiles that are stored in the indexed db database and the space used by them. The callback is called with an object containing the result of this calculation:

```js
	{
		tileCount: /* count of tiles */
		size: /* total size of tiles */	
	}
```
####basemap.getTilePolygons(callback)
It calculates the geographic boundary of each of the tiles stored in the indexed db. This method calls the callback once for each tile, passing an esri/geometry/Polygon that can be added to a GraphicsLayer. This method is useful to show graphically which tiles are stored in the local database, like this:
```js
	graphics = new GraphicsLayer();
	map.addLayer( graphics );
	basemapLayer.getTilePolygons(function(polygon,err)
	{
		if(polygon) {
			var graphic = new Graphic(polygon, symbol);
			graphics.add(graphic);
		} else {
			console.log("showStoredTiles: ", err);
		}
	}
```

##`edit` library

The `edit` library allows a developer to extend a feature layer with offline editing support.

**Step 1** Include `offline.min.js`, `tiles/offlineTilesEnabler` and `tiles/editsStore` in your app.

```html	
	<script src="../vendor/offline/offline.min.js"></script>
	<script>
	require([
		"esri/map", 
		"edit/offlineFeaturesManager",
	    "edit/editsStore", 
		function(Map,OfflineFeaturesManager,editsStore)
	{
		...
	});
```
**Step 2** Once your map is created (either using new Map() or using esriUtils.createMap(webmapid,...), you create a new OfflineFeaturesManager instance and starting assigning events listeners to tie the library into your user interface:

```js
		var offlineFeaturesManager = new OfflineFeaturesManager();
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_ENQUEUED, updateStatus);
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT, updateStatus);
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.ALL_EDITS_SENT, updateStatus);
```		

**Step 3** Create an array of FeatureLayers and add them to the map, and listen for the `layers-add-result` event to continue FeatureLayer and editor widgets initialization

```js
	map.on('layers-add-result', initEditor);
	
	var fsUrl = "http://services2.arcgis.com/CQWCKwrSm5dkM28A/arcgis/rest/services/Military/FeatureServer/";
		// var layersIds = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6];
		var layersIds = [1,2,3];
		var featureLayers = [];

		layersIds.forEach(function(layerId)
		{
			var layer = new FeatureLayer(fsUrl + layerId, {
				mode: FeatureLayer.MODE_SNAPSHOT,
				outFields: ['*']
			});
			featureLayers.push(layer);			
		})

		map.addLayers(featureLayers);
```

**Step 4** After the `layers-add-result` event fires, iterate thru each layer and extend it using the `extend()` method:

```js
		function initEditor(evt)
		{
			try {
				/* extend layer with offline detection functionality */
				evt.layers.forEach(function(result)
				{
					var layer = result.layer;
					offlineFeaturesManager.extend(layer);
					layer.on('update-end', logCurrentObjectIds);
				});
			catch(err){
			 	. . .
			}		
		}			
```
**Step 5** Use the new offline methods on the layer to prepare for offline mode while still online. Here are a few examples that include code snippets of how to take advantage of some of the libraries methods. You can use a combination of methods from `editsStore` and `offlineFeaturesManager`.

####offlineFeaturesManager.goOffline()
Force the library to go offline. Once this condition is set, then any offline edits will be cached locally.

```js
		function goOffline()
		{
			offlineFeaturesManager.goOffline();
			//TO-DO
		}
```

####offlineFeaturesManager.goOnline()
Force the library to return to an online condition. If there are pending edits, the library will attempt to sync them.

```js
		function goOnline()
		{			
			offlineFeaturesManager.goOnline(function()
			{
				//Modify user inteface depending on success/failure
			});
		}
```

####offlineFeaturesManager.getOnlineStatus()
Within your application you can manually check online status and then update your user interface. By using a switch/case statement you can check against three enums that indicate if the library thinks it is offline, online or in the process of reconnecting.

```js		
			switch( offlineFeaturesManager.getOnlineStatus() )
			{
				case offlineFeaturesManager.OFFLINE:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-chain-broken'></i> offline";
					domClass.add(node, "offline");
					break;
				case offlineFeaturesManager.ONLINE:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-link'></i> online";
					domClass.add(node, "online");
					break;
				case offlineFeaturesManager.RECONNECTING:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-cog fa-spin'></i> reconnecting";
					domClass.add(node, "reconnecting");
					break;
			}
		
```

####editsStore.hasPendingEdits()
You can check if there are any edits pending. If there are then iterate `editsStore._retrieveEditsQueue()` and then convert the edits to a readable format via `offlineFeaturesManager.getReadableEdit(edit)`. 		
```js
			if( editsStore.hasPendingEdits())
			{
				var edits = editsStore._retrieveEditsQueue();
				edits.forEach(function(edit)
				{
					var readableEdit = offlineFeaturesManager.getReadableEdit(edit);
					//Update user interface to display readable edits
				},this);
			}
			else
			{
				//Tell user interface no edits are pending
			}
```

##Setup Instructions

1. [Fork and clone the repo.](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. After cloning from github, `cd` into the `offline-editor-js` folder
3. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
4. Examples in the `/samples` folder should work now.

##Dependencies

* ArcGIS API for JavaScript (v3.8+)
* NOTE: browser limitations and technical dependencies. The offline capabilities in this toolkit depend on the following (psuedo-persistent ) HTML5 capabilities being present in the browser:
	* localStorage. The limits vary by browser and is typically 5MBs per domain name. For additional information see W3C's webstorage specification, [Section 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/).
	* indexedDB. Storage limits for indexedDB are not necessarily consistent across browsers. It's generally understood to be 50MB. Here is a Mozilla [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB#Storage_limits) discussing limits across different browsers. 
	* Advanced users of the library should be aware that JavaScript stores some strings as UTF-16. More information can be found in this Mozilla [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length).
	* If a user completely flushes their browser cache all queued edits and tiles will most likely be lost.
	* Data stored by the library should persist if the browser is shutdown and restarted. However, this does not mean that your application will be returned to its correct state. A client web application's state has to be programmatically managed. This includes the state of items including but not limited to feature layers within your application.

* Sub-modules (see `/vendor` directory)

   * [offline.js](https://github.com/hubspot/offline) - it allows detection of the online/offline condition and provides events to hook callbacks on when this condition changes
   * [IndexedDBShim](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim) - polyfill to simulate indexed db functionality in browsers/platforms where it is not supported (notably iOS Safari, PhoneGap, Android Chrome)
   		- IMPORTANT: There is a know [issue](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/115) with IndexedDBShim on Safari. The workaround is to switch from using /dist/IndexedDBShim.min.js to just using IndexedDBShim.js and then modify line #1467 to a more appropriate size that will meet all your storage needs, for example: ```var DEFAULT_DB_SIZE = 24 * 1024 * 1024```
   * [jasmine.async](https://github.com/derickbailey/jasmine.async.git) - library to help implementing tests of async functionality (used in tests)

* Non sub-module based library(s)
	* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/Esri/offline-editor-js/blob/master/lib/tiles/README.md) - library to assist with uploading and downloading of files containing tile information.
